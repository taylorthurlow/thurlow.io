In the digital age, a film photographer's relationship with the post-development phase of photography has undergone a dramatic change. Though still absolutely an option to those willing to make the effort, the process of darkroom printing has gone from an integral step in the system, to a niche within an already small niche of photography. In its place is a seemingly simple step; digital scanning.

I've identified a cultural trend in the world of film photography that I think places far too much emphasis on "the film look" and "unedited" photos. I have come to attribute it to a fundamental lack of understanding of the process, both scientifically and philosophically.

Hopefully, I'll make it clear that I am specifically trying avoid any discussion of "creative merit". While some photographs may end up having more... "cultural relevance" than others, part of my goal here is to blow the lid off of the creative box that some film photographers tend to construct around themselves, myself included. I'm here to explain why you may be making some false assumptions about the film photography process - not to tell you how to do any of it.

OK - let's start with a question.

## What's happening when you take a photo?

Bear with me here  - the answer to this is nearly the point of this whole video. I'm looking for a literal answer - a physical one. You are creating an image. *Show applicable definition of image*

When I take a picture with my camera, the film captures light in a way that reflects the world in front of the lens. In all respects we can now say this part of the film loaded into my camera contains not the world itself, but a _representation_ of it. A new and distinct thing, that has many similarities to the world as it was in front of the lens, but that is different in every other possible way. The image, now chemically etched into the emulsion, can perhaps rightfully be said to have been "born". Before this point, the image did not exist. Now, we have a concrete object, the film, that we can, through some series of steps, use to produce a photograph that reflects the world as it was in front of the lens, when I took the picture with my camera.

Now, obviously, for our purposes, the image doesn't really do us any good in its current state. And so, we must _change it_.

## Changing our image, and identifying further creative decisions

I'd like emphasize my use of the word _change_. The idea behind this is the foundation on which the rest of my argument is built. In order to get to this point, just after having "taken" the photo, we've applied our creative understanding of photography through our choice of composition, framing, film, gear, etc. Only now do we have an image - an image that we are free to do absolutely anything with. Now, if you want to use your eyeballs to "see" the image you just created, you'll have to change it.

The only rule in changing your photo from this point on, is that there are no rules. Every piece of advice another photographer has ever given you on the subject of photography is _always_ a suggestion, not a rule. Even if they do sometimes sound like rules. Those suggestions, if followed, may be _incredibly_ helpful in achieving a final photograph that looks the way you want it to look.

The first suggestion you might hear from a fellow film photographer is "develop your film". This... is a helpful one. Or, it probably is, anyways. If your goal is to shoot a roll of film, and leave the film in the canister to exist as an undeveloped series of images not visible to the human eye, then your journey is over, and it's time to shoot your next roll. Doing something like that is entirely your right.

Let's assume that you don't fall into that camp, and you have chosen to develop your film. In what I would consider a "standard" approach to film photography, you are now faced with the first major decision on how your image is changed on its way to being "finished". You might choose to drop your undeveloped film off at a lab to be processed, or you might choose to develop at home. This is one of many points at which a photographer must decide how much creative control will be relinquished to someone other than themselves. This has already likely happened a few times; camera selection, lens selection, film selection - all things the typical photographer chooses to relinquish control of, and for perfectly valid reasons.

Development, and many steps after, are the same. You can choose how much of your own creative
